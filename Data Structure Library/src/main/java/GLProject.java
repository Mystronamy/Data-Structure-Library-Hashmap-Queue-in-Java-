// Brief Description: 
// This project implements custom data structures including a HashMap and a Queue.
// These data structures are implemented without using any pre-existing libraries.
// The project also provides iterators for these structures, allowing traversal
// through the elements in both forward and reverse directions. The Queue is based 
// on a singly linked list (FIFO), and the HashMap uses the Queue for collision handling.
